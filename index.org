My, my! What a strange place you wandered into!

Welcome to the Things of Whatt; a blog about the musings, amusements,
and otherwise of [[https://github.com/thingywhat/][thingywhat]].

I will occasionally, write on the topics of programming, fetishes, and
every possible combination of these topics. (Innumerable, I know!)

If you have any interesting questions for me, I might blog an answer
or two as well. Who knows?

Happy reading, and hope my sarcasm doesn't eat too much into your
brains.
