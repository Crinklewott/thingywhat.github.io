Heyas! Welcome to an experiment.

What kind of experiment, you ask?

The Emacs blog kind, of course!

This site is planned to be a little personal blog where I can post
projects, thoughts, ideas... Maybe even a little philosophy every now
and then.

I should note, that while the blog and my repositories are SFW, there
are links to some very NSFW things in here, so if you are under 18, I
would recommend proceeding with caution.
