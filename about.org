#+TITLE: About

Hey all! I am thingywhat, a taker of naps and consumer of
coffee...

Most of my development time is spent working on things that either
entertain, or are useful to people with similar interests to myself.
I might also poke around some science every now and then.

If you are curious about the avatar, it came from [[http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=11354643][this sweet artist]] on
Pixiv.
