#+TITLE: About

* About thingywhat

Hey all! I am thingywhat, a taker of naps and consumer of coffee... Or
for the uninitialized: a programmer.

I am not just any programmer either, no, I am a /fetishist/
programmer. A fetishist programmer with an interest in developing
things that either entertain, or are useful to people with similar
interests to myself.

I might also poke around some science every now and then too, but I'm
not really good at it. (Yet!)
