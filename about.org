* About thingywhat

Hey all! I am thingywhat, a taker of naps and consumer of
coffee... (Programmer)

Then again, that should come as no surprise if you notice the domain.

Most of my development time is spent working on things that either
entertain, or are useful to people with similar interests to myself.

I might also poke around some science every now and then too, but I'm
not really good at it. (Yet!)
